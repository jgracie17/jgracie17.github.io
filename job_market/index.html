        <p style="font-size: 11pt">(with Benjamin Goldman)</p>
        <!<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:30px; text-align: justify; font-size: 11pt;"><b>Abstract: </b>Why do students in high-poverty schools perform worse academically and in the labor market than their peers in low-poverty schools? We show that a key difference is how regularly students attend school. We use transitory shocks to absences arising from factors like respiratory illnesses to estimate the effect of improving school-wide attendance. Moving from the 75th to the 25th percentile of the absence distribution among high-poverty schools would raise high school graduation rates by 2.3 percentage points and increase average earnings at age 25 by $3,600. Our findings suggest that up to one-third of the achievement gap between low- and high-poverty schools can be attributed to absenteeism. We show that policies aimed at improving attendance in high-poverty schools can close these disparities in outcomes. We estimate that nationwide adoption of "Communities in Schools", the country's largest student support program, could reduce the achievement gap by 20%, primarily through its effect on attendance.</p>
