        <p style="font-size: 11pt">(with Benjamin Goldman)</p>
        <!<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:30px; text-align: justify; font-size: 11pt;"><b>Abstract: </b>Students in high-poverty schools are less likely to graduate, attend college, and succeed in the labor market compared to their peers in low-poverty schools. Absenteeism rates are significantly higher in high-poverty schools---a factor that may contribute to this gap and a problem that has worsened in the aftermath of the pandemic. We use quasi-experimental variation in absences due to factors like respiratory illnesses to estimate the effect of improving school-wide attendance on academic performance and long-term outcomes. Our findings suggest that up to one-third of the achievement gap between low- and high-poverty schools can be explained by absenteeism. Motivated by this, we evaluate the impact of Communities in Schools, a student support program aimed at reducing absenteeism. Our estimates suggest that nationwide adoption of this program in high-poverty schools could reduce the achievement gap by 20\%, primarily through its effect on attendance. This provides encouraging evidence for addressing the recent rise in absenteeism.</p>>
