		I am a postdoctoral fellow with the <a href="https://edredesign.org">EdRedesign Lab</a> at Harvard University and an affiliate of <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org">Opportunity Insights</a>. I received my PhD in Economics from Harvard in 2025, where I was a <a href="https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/phd-training">Stone Scholar</a> in Inequality and Wealth Concentration. My research is in labor and public economics with a focus on economic mobility.
